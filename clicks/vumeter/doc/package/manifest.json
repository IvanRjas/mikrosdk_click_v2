    "short_description": "VU Meter Click is a compact add-on board representing a volume unit meter that displays the intensity of an audio signal. This board features the LM3914, a monolithic integrated circuit that senses analog voltage levels and drives a 10-segment bar graph display from Texas Instruments. This Click board™ is manufactured with a sound detecting device (microphone), Op-Amp, and the LM3914, which gleams the bar graph display according to the sound’s quality. The LM3914 is an analog-controlled driver meaning it can control (turn ON or OFF) a display by an analog input voltage and eliminates the need for additional programming.",
